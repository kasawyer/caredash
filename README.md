# CareDash take-home test

I built out the API endpoints using Rails. I used the FactoryGirl gem for testing and included tests for controllers and models since I'm a big proponent of test-driven development.

For the front end, I used Foundation and custom HTML and CSS. I was having issues with Foundation and JavaScript, so the login/sign-up tabs aren't working properly, unfortunately. I would have liked for them to toggle back and forth.
